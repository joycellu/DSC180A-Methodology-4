**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was latent reasoning in multimodal large language models, which is how models can develop internal visual imagination during reasoning. I read papers such as “Latent Sketchpad: Sketching Visual Thoughts to Elicit Multimodal Reasoning In MLLMs," which explored how models can produce internal sketches to visualize reasoning steps, similar to how humans use "mental imagery" when solving a complex multimodal problem. I found this interesting because it allows models to imagine and plan through internal visual processes in order to solve advanced multimodal problems such as spatial reasoning and navigation tasks. This idea also connects with human cognitive patterns of visual imagination and problem solving.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to explore combining latent reasoning with tool-use agents. Current tool-using LLM agents can search, plan, and call APIs, but it would be interesting to add internal reasoning and imagination to give the ability to simulate outcomes before acting. It would be interesting to investigate whether integrating a latent reasoning component could improve an agent's decision-making and efficiency, for example, by allowing it to internally visualize intermediate steps before executing tools. 

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would make to my current project is to extend the latent reasoning framework into a more interactive, decision-making setting, such as tool-use agents. Instead of limiting the model to latent prediction, I would explore how latent reasoning could guide action selection, for example, allowing the agent to simulate outcomes before deciding which tool to use. This change could transform the project into a reasoning-driven decision-making framework, enhancing its performance in real-world scenarios.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in exploring techniques that integrate latent reasoning with tool-use capabilities to enable models that can both simulate and act. For example, incorporating reinforcement learning with feedback from tool-use outcomes, where the model refines its latent reasoning ability based on whether its internal predictions align with real-world results. Another technique is retrieval augmented reasoning, which allows the model to retrieve prior latent or visual representations before deciding on a tool call, improving contextual awareness.
